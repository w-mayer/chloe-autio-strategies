# Moving Your Website from Squarespace to Netlify: A Simple Guide

## What This Guide Covers

This guide will help you move your website from Squarespace to Netlify. Think of it like moving your business from one office building to another - we need to pack everything up, move it safely, and make sure everything works in the new location.

## Before You Start: What You Need to Know

### Your Current Situation
- You have a website hosted on Squarespace
- You want to move it to Netlify (a different hosting company)
- Your website is already built and ready to go
- Your domain name is `autiostrategies.com`

### What You'll Need
- Access to your Squarespace account
- Access to your domain name settings (where you bought your domain)
- About 1-2 weeks to complete the move safely

## Step-by-Step Moving Process

### Step 1: Prepare for the Move (Days 1-2)

#### Save Everything from Squarespace
- Download all your website content
- Save all your images and files
- Export your blog posts and pages
- Save any contact form submissions
- Take screenshots of how your site looks now

#### Check Your Domain
- Find out where you bought your domain name
- Make sure you can access your domain settings
- Write down your current website settings

#### List Your Services
- Make a list of any tools connected to your website (like Google Analytics)
- Note any email addresses you use with your domain
- List any other services that work with your website

### Step 2: Set Up Your New Home on Netlify (Day 3)

#### Create Your Netlify Account
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Click "Sign Up" and create a free account
3. Check your email to confirm your account

#### Connect Your Website
1. In Netlify, click "New site from Git"
2. Choose GitHub (where your website files are stored)
3. Select your website project
4. Netlify will automatically set up the right settings

#### Test Your New Site
1. Netlify will give you a temporary web address
2. Click on it to see your website
3. Check that everything looks right
4. Test your contact forms
5. Make sure all pages work

### Step 3: Move Your Domain Name (Days 4-5)

#### Tell Netlify About Your Domain
1. In Netlify, go to "Site settings"
2. Click "Domain management"
3. Click "Add custom domain"
4. Type in: `autiostrategies.com`

#### Update Your Domain Settings
You have two options:

**Option A: Let Netlify Manage Everything (Recommended)**
- This is like hiring a property manager for your domain
- Netlify handles all the technical details
- You just need to update a few settings where you bought your domain

**Option B: Keep Your Current Domain Manager**
- You'll need to update some settings yourself
- This requires a bit more technical knowledge

#### Set Up Email (If You Have It)

### Step 4: Make Sure Everything Works (Days 6-7)

#### Test Your Website
- Visit your website using your domain name
- Check every page works
- Test your contact forms
- Make sure images load properly
- Check that your website works on phones and tablets

#### Update Your Website Content

#### Check Your Search Engine Settings
- Make sure search engines can still find your website
- Update your website's description and keywords
- Submit your new website address to Google

### Step 5: Clean Up (Day 8)

#### Save Everything from Squarespace
- Export one final copy of your Squarespace site
- Download all your files
- Save any settings you might need later

#### Cancel Squarespace
