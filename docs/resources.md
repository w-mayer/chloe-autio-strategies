# Adding Resources to Chloe Autio Strategies

This guide explains how to add new resources to the website for non-technical users. The website supports several types of resources that can be either internal (hosted on our site) or external (links to other websites).

## Resource Types

The website supports four main types of resources:

1. **Articles** - News articles, blog posts, and thought leadership content
2. **Policy Briefs** - Detailed policy analysis and recommendations
3. **Case Studies** - Real-world examples of AI policy implementation
4. **Resources** - Tools, datasets, guidelines, and other reference materials

## Before You Begin

### Required Information
For any resource, you'll need to gather:

- **Title** - A clear, descriptive title
- **Summary** - A brief description (1-2 sentences)
- **Content** - The full content (for internal resources) or a brief description (for external)
- **Date** - Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **Tags** - Relevant topics for categorization
- **Author Information** - Name, title, and bio
- **External URL** - For external resources (optional for internal)

### File Locations
All resource data is stored in: `src/data/resources.ts`

## Adding Articles

### Step 1: Prepare Your Content

For **internal articles** (hosted on our site):
- Write the full article content in HTML format
- Include proper formatting (paragraphs, headings, lists)
- Add any relevant images (contact technical team for image uploads)

For **external articles** (links to other sites):
- Get the full URL of the external article
- Write a brief summary of the article
- Note the publication date

### Step 2: Add to the Articles Array

Open `src/data/resources.ts` and find the `articles` array (around line 60). Add a new entry following this format:

```typescript
{
  slug: 'your-article-slug',
  title: 'Your Article Title',
  summary: 'Brief summary of the article content.',
  content: '<p>Your full article content in HTML format.</p>',
  date: '2024-12-15',
  author: authors[0], // Use authors[0] for Chloe, authors[1] for external
  tags: ['AI Policy', 'Technology', 'Your Tags'],
  featured: true, // Set to true to feature on homepage
  related: [], // Add related article slugs if any
  externalUrl: 'https://external-site.com/article', // Only for external articles
},
```

### Step 3: Create the Slug

The slug should be:
- All lowercase
- Use hyphens instead of spaces
- Be descriptive but short
- Unique across all resources

Examples:
- `trump-ai-policy-appointment`
- `eu-ai-act-analysis-2024`
- `ai-governance-best-practices`

## Adding Policy Briefs

### Step 1: Prepare Your Content

Policy briefs are typically more detailed than articles and focus on specific policy topics.

### Step 2: Add to the Policy Briefs Array

Find the `policyBriefs` array in `src/data/resources.ts` and add:

```typescript
{
  slug: 'your-policy-brief-slug',
  title: 'Your Policy Brief Title',
  summary: 'Brief summary of the policy brief.',
  content: '<p>Your full policy brief content in HTML format.</p>',
  date: '2024-12-15',
  author: authors[0], // Use authors[0] for Chloe, authors[1] for external
  tags: ['Policy Brief', 'AI Regulation', 'Your Tags'],
  externalUrl: 'https://external-site.com/brief', // Only for external briefs
},
```

## Adding Case Studies

### Step 1: Prepare Your Content

Case studies should include:
- Organization name
- Implementation details
- Outcomes and results
- Lessons learned

### Step 2: Add to the Case Studies Array

Find the `caseStudies` array in `src/data/resources.ts` and add:

```typescript
{
  slug: 'your-case-study-slug',
  title: 'Your Case Study Title',
  summary: 'Brief summary of the case study.',
  content: '<p>Your full case study content in HTML format.</p>',
  date: '2024-12-15',
  organization: 'Organization Name',
  author: authors[0], // Use authors[0] for Chloe, authors[1] for external
  tags: ['Case Study', 'AI Governance', 'Your Tags'],
  externalUrl: 'https://external-site.com/case-study', // Only for external
},
```

## Adding General Resources

### Step 1: Prepare Your Information

General resources include:
- Reports
- Toolkits
- Datasets
- Guidelines

### Step 2: Add to the Resources Array

Find the `resources` array in `src/data/resources.ts` and add:

```typescript
{
  slug: 'your-resource-slug',
  title: 'Your Resource Title',
  url: 'https://external-site.com/resource',
  description: 'Brief description of the resource and its value.',
  type: 'report', // Options: 'report', 'toolkit', 'dataset', 'guideline'
},
```

## Adding New Authors

If you need to add a new author, find the `authors` array in `src/data/resources.ts` and add:

```typescript
{
  name: 'Author Name',
  title: 'Author Title',
  bio: 'Brief biography of the author.',
  avatarUrl: '/profile-placeholder.jpg', // Contact technical team for custom images
},
```

Then reference the new author in your resource using `authors[2]`, `authors[3]`, etc.

## Internal vs External Resources

### Internal Resources
- Content is hosted on our website
- Full content is written in the `content` field
- Users read the content directly on our site
- Better for SEO and user engagement
- Use when you have full rights to the content

### External Resources
- Content is hosted elsewhere
- `externalUrl` field contains the link
- `content` field contains a brief description
- Users are directed to the external site
- Use when linking to third-party content

## Technical Implementation

### Unified Resource Display

All resource types (articles, policy briefs, case studies, and general resources) are displayed using a single unified `ResourceCard` component. This ensures consistent styling and behavior across all resource types.

The component automatically:
- Displays the appropriate information based on resource type
- Shows dates for content resources (articles, policy briefs, case studies)
- Shows type badges for general resources
- Handles both internal and external links
- Displays tags for content resources
- Shows author names, organization names, or resource types as appropriate

### Resource Display Logic

The unified component uses type detection to display the right information:

- **Articles**: Shows date, author, tags, and summary
- **Policy Briefs**: Shows date, author, tags, and summary  
- **Case Studies**: Shows date, organization, tags, and summary
- **General Resources**: Shows type badge, description, and no date

## Best Practices

### Content Guidelines
- Keep titles clear and descriptive
- Write compelling summaries (1-2 sentences)
- Use relevant tags for better categorization
- Include proper HTML formatting for internal content
- Ensure all external links are working

### SEO Considerations
- Use descriptive slugs
- Include relevant keywords in titles and summaries
- Add appropriate tags for categorization
- Keep content up-to-date

### Technical Notes
- All dates should be in YYYY-MM-DD format
- HTML content should use proper tags (`<p>`, `<h2>`, `<ul>`, etc.)
- External URLs should be complete (include `https://`)
- Slugs must be unique across all resource types

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Resource not appearing on the website:**
- Check that the slug is unique
- Ensure all required fields are filled
- Verify the date format is correct

**External link not working:**
- Ensure the URL is complete (starts with `https://`)
- Test the link in a browser
- Check if the external site is accessible

**Content not formatting correctly:**
- Verify HTML tags are properly closed
- Use simple HTML tags (`<p>`, `<strong>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`)
- Avoid complex CSS or JavaScript

### Getting Help

## Examples

### Example 1: Adding an External News Article

Here's a complete example of adding a news article that links to an external source:

```typescript
{
  slug: 'biden-ai-executive-order-2024',
  title: 'Biden Administration Issues New AI Executive Order',
  summary: 'President Biden signs comprehensive executive order establishing new AI safety and governance standards for federal agencies and contractors.',
  content: '<p>Read the full article at the White House website.</p>',
  date: '2024-12-15',
  author: authors[1], // External source
  tags: ['AI Policy', 'Executive Order', 'Federal Policy', 'Biden Administration'],
  featured: true,
  related: [],
  externalUrl: 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/12/15/executive-order-on-ai-safety/',
},
```
